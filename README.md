# MyGraphicsEngine
The aim of this project is to create my very first game engine using one of my favorite language Rust.
This is a long term project that will most likely not going to be completed due to its complexity. However, the goal is not for its completion but to gain understanding of many concepts in computer graphics and the rust programming language.
